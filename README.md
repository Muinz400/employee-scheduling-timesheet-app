## Workforce Scheduling & Timesheet Management System


**Overview**


This project is a full-stack workforce management system designed to help organizations streamline employee scheduling, time tracking, and payroll preparation workflows.


The system centralizes scheduling, clock-ins, and timesheet records in one place, reducing manual work and improving organization.


This project was built to simulate a real-world internal operations tool used by teams managing multiple employees across multiple locations.

## Problem


Many organizations rely on manual processes to manage:

employee schedules

paper timesheets

manual hour calculations

shift documentation

mileage tracking




**Manual workflows can:**

require significant administrative time

increase risk of calculation errors

make records harder to track

create inefficiencies in payroll preparation



The goal of this project was to design a simple system that organizes these workflows digitally while keeping the process familiar and easy to adopt.

## Solution

The application provides a centralized interface where employees and administrators can manage schedules, track hours, and maintain records efficiently.



**Employees can:**

clock in and clock out digitally

view assigned shifts

record mileage

add daily shift notes



**Administrators can:**

create and manage schedules

monitor employee activity

review timesheets

calculate total worked hours

estimate payroll totals

export schedules as PDF




**Key Features**

Authentication & Role-Based Access

Secure login using Supabase Auth

Separate Admin and Employee permissions

Row Level Security policies applied to protect data access




**Employee Clock In / Clock Out**

Employees can clock in and out digitally

System records timestamps automatically

Location coordinates captured for verification

Total worked hours calculated automatically




**Timesheet Tracking**

Employees can review worked hours in one place

Total hours automatically calculated

Structured records ready for payroll preparation




**Weekly Schedule Management**

Admin can create and edit shifts

Weekly calendar grouped by house and day

Supports multiple employees across multiple locations

Shifts can be added directly from weekly calendar interface




**Mileage & Shift Documentation**

Employees can log mileage per shift

Daily shift notes stored with schedule records

Improves documentation and accountability




**Payroll Preparation Support**

Calculates total hours worked per employee

Date range filtering for payroll periods

Simplifies payroll preparation workflow




**PDF Export**

Weekly schedules can be exported as PDF

Allows easy sharing or printing of schedules

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
